# hello-world
First GitHub repository - practice
My name is Luke and I am learning to use GitHub so that I can use version control for my upcoming data science projects.
I am a Mechanical Engineer who has a passion for data science, with experience in Python.
I am currently trying to learn R, and the course that I am following to do so recommends (and teaches) the use of GitHub.
